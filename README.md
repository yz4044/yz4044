Hi Folks! My name is Yunhan Zhang. I grew up in Beijing, the capital of China. 
Beijing is a metropolis just like New York with a population of more than twenty million, but I live in a low-density suburb area with some greenbelt.
I am studying QMSS (Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences) in the Columbia University and I graduated from Penn State with a finance major. 
I’m really into the subject of finance, especially stock analysis, so I also work as an analyst intern at GF securities. 
Our team is covering the energy sector and I am in charge of writing weekly report tracking the price and inventory change of coal. 
During my free time, I enjoy swimming and playing video games. 
I have been a professional swimmer since seven. 
It’s pretty sad that there is only a 15-meter pool in our apartment, which is not quite useful, so I change to workout at the gym.
